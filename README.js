===============================
What is it?
  -----------
  This game is a programming assignment that is designed by Udacity to
	provide a platform for training students how to program using object
	oriented Java script. I am taking this course as part of a Front End Web Design
	program.

	The engine.js, resources.js, graphics files, html and css files are provided
	by Udacity. They retain the property rights to this code.

	About two thirds of the app.js code is completed by
	the sudent(Me).  The other third of the app.js code provides a framework
	to get the student started.
